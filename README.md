#### Project Status: [Active] 

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to write an algorithm to detect fruits and vegetables.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Transfer Learning

### Technologies
* tensorflow
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Streamlit
* Google Colab Pro
* pillow
* Object Detection API

### Data
Download the whole dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits

This repo contains a few  samples from the data.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.
Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring.
What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the
problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?
Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Models
* CNN
* MobileNetV2
* VGG-16(model trained on dataset) - was not included in the streamlit app because it was too big but you can find it in the notebook.
* VGG16 (Object Detection API)
* ResNet50 (Object Detection API)
* EfficientNetB0 (Object Detection API)
